                All great stories start where this one startedâ€¦two good buddies, a few beers, and a creek full of bass! <br>
                <br>
                Back in 2018, Beer Brothers Fishing began as a friendly, but competitive, fishing tournament between two
                friends that has developed into a love for teaching people how to fish. <br>

                The techniques we teach here are proven and have worked for us for many years. <br>
                <br> 
                We have over 70 years of combined fishing experience that we want to pass
                on to both newcomers and seasoned anglers alike.
