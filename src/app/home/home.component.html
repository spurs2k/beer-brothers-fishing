            All great stories start where this one startedâ€¦two good buddies, a few beers, and a creek full of bass!
            Back in 2018, Beer Brothers Fishing began as a friendly, but competitive, fishing tournament between two
            friends that has developed into a love for teaching people how to fish.
            The techniques we teach here are proven and have worked for us for many years. We have over 70 years of
            combined fishing experience that we want to pass
            on to both newcomers and seasoned anglers alike.
